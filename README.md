# Java-SalesSystem

I took an introductory computer science II course while I was getting my math PhD. During this course we created a Java backed sales application for an imaginary company. The sales system would create basic Java objects to caclulate costs and records. The record system integrates a SQL database. 

I cannot share the assignment since it repeats semester to semester, but I've attached the design document for the project.
